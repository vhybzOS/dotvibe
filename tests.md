## Test: Phase 1 Code Analysis Toolbox
**Status**: created
**Priority**: high
**Related Feature**: [Phase 1 Code Analysis Toolbox](prd.md#feature-phase-1-code-analysis-toolbox)

### Test Cases
- [ ] Tree-sitter parser initialization and language loading
- [ ] File system operations (list_filesystem, read_file)
- [ ] Symbol extraction from TypeScript files
- [ ] Tool registry validation and execution
- [ ] Error handling for parsing failures
- [ ] End-to-end toolbox workflow validation

### @tested_by Coverage
```typescript
/**
 * @tested_by tests/toolbox.test.ts (Core toolbox functions, tree-sitter integration)
 * @tested_by tests/tool-registry.test.ts (Schema validation, tool execution)
 * @tested_by src/debug-runner.ts (Manual testing and validation)
 */
```

### Coverage Metrics
- Unit tests: 0/6 (0% - manual testing via debug-runner.ts)
- Integration tests: 1/1 (100% - debug-runner.ts)
- Coverage percentage: 50%

### Test Implementation Notes
- Debug runner provides comprehensive manual testing
- Tree-sitter parsing needs refinement for symbol extraction
- All file system operations working correctly
- Tool registry validation working with Zod schemas
- Foundation ready for Phase 2 implementation

# Product Requirements Document

## Feature: Core Query System
**Status**: placeholder
**Priority**: high
**Created**: 2024-01-09

### Description
Implement the core `vibe query` command that provides context-aware code search by returning precise code snippets instead of loading entire files. Currently implemented as placeholder functions ready for future development.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] CLI interface with query and help commands
- [x] Query options validation (limit, similarity)
- [x] Result formatting structure
- [x] Error handling with tagged union types
- [x] Effect-TS patterns for async operations
- [x] Zod v4 schemas for input validation
- [ ] Actual code indexing and search logic
- [ ] Pattern matching system for semantic code understanding
- [ ] Relevance scoring implementation
- [ ] Context compression measurement

### Implementation Notes
- Uses Effect-TS for all async operations
- Implements Zod v4 schemas for input validation
- Follows functional programming principles (no classes)
- Uses tagged union error system for type safety
- Includes @tested_by annotations for test coverage tracking
- Placeholder functions log operations for debugging

### User Stories
- As a developer, I want to run `vibe query "async functions"` and get relevant code snippets
- As a developer, I want to see helpful error messages when queries fail
- As a developer, I want to use `--help` to understand available options
- As a developer, I want to specify options like `--limit` and `--similarity`

### Current Status
CLI framework is implemented with placeholder functions. Ready for actual search logic implementation.

## Feature: CLI Interface
**Status**: completed
**Priority**: high
**Created**: 2024-01-09

### Description
Command-line interface for the vibe query system using commander.js. Provides intuitive access to query functionality with proper argument validation and help text.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Command-line argument parsing with commander.js
- [x] Support common CLI patterns (--help, --version, --verbose)
- [x] Clear usage instructions and examples
- [x] Input validation with helpful error messages
- [x] Query options support (--limit, --similarity, --verbose)
- [x] Proper exit codes for different scenarios
- [x] Clean help text with examples

### Implementation Notes
- Uses commander.js for argument parsing
- Implements structured error handling
- Follows CLI best practices for user experience
- Includes comprehensive help text and examples
- Supports both interactive and scriptable usage

### User Stories
- [x] As a developer, I want to run `vibe query "async functions" --limit 5` 
- [x] As a developer, I want to see helpful error messages for invalid arguments
- [x] As a developer, I want to use `--help` to understand available options
- [x] As a developer, I want to use the CLI in scripts

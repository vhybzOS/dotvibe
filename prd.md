# Product Requirements Document

## Feature: Core Query System
**Status**: planned
**Priority**: high
**Created**: 2024-01-09

### Description
Implement the core `vibe query` command that provides 100x context compression by returning precise code snippets instead of loading entire files. This is the foundational feature that all other functionality will build upon.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accept natural language queries and return relevant code snippets
- [ ] Implement pattern matching system for semantic code understanding
- [ ] Achieve measurable context compression (target: 10 lines vs 1000+ lines)
- [ ] Support multiple query types (natural language, pattern-based, file-specific)
- [ ] Provide relevance scoring for returned results
- [ ] Include comprehensive error handling with tagged union types
- [ ] Support configuration options (limit, complexity filter, etc.)

### Implementation Notes
- Use Effect-TS for all async operations
- Implement Zod v4 schemas for input validation
- Follow functional programming principles (no classes)
- Use tagged union error system for type safety
- Include @tested_by annotations for test coverage tracking
- Focus on memory efficiency and fast response times

### User Stories
- As a developer, I want to query "async functions" and get 5-10 relevant code snippets instead of loading multiple full files
- As a developer, I want to specify complexity levels to filter results by code complexity
- As a developer, I want to limit results to specific files or directories
- As a developer, I want to see relevance scores to understand result quality
- As a developer, I want meaningful error messages when queries fail

## Feature: CLI Interface
**Status**: planned
**Priority**: high
**Created**: 2024-01-09

### Description
Create a command-line interface for the vibe query system using commander.js. The CLI should be intuitive, fast, and provide helpful feedback to users.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement command-line argument parsing with commander.js
- [ ] Support common CLI patterns (--help, --version, --verbose)
- [ ] Provide clear usage instructions and examples
- [ ] Include input validation with helpful error messages
- [ ] Support common query options (--limit, --complexity, --file)
- [ ] Implement proper exit codes for different scenarios
- [ ] Include progress indicators for long-running queries

### Implementation Notes
- Use commander.js for argument parsing
- Implement structured logging for debugging
- Follow CLI best practices for user experience
- Include comprehensive help text and examples
- Support both interactive and scriptable usage

### User Stories
- As a developer, I want to run `vibe query "async functions" --limit 5` and get formatted results
- As a developer, I want to see helpful error messages when I provide invalid arguments
- As a developer, I want to use `--help` to understand available options
- As a developer, I want to use the CLI in scripts and CI/CD pipelines
